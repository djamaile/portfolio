I recently made the decision to leave Bol.com.

<!--truncate-->

## The last two years

So, for the past two years I have been a Software Engineer at Bol.com.
Not only that I was also enrolled in a special program called: Young Professional.
Being a YP it is expected of you to learn, move around and also build a community within Bol.com with other YP's.
It's for sure a good feeling, because sometimes it felt like being back at school :smile.

### The good

Bol.com is a great company to start out in, maybe even the best.
Why? Because Bol.com gives you a lot of freedom to do **a lot**.
Meaning, in big companies it can be quite hard to just test out new shiny libraries, push to main or even to switch teams.
In Bol.com, I could do all of that and even more. In addition, Bol.com also uses a lot of new technology and most of the time it is ahead of what the market is doing (platform wise at least). 

Not to mention that I also really enjoyed the YP community. Being in the YP community meant you got free trips, events and swag!
Unfortunately, though I joined during COVID. So, I didn't get to get the full experience, but with what I got, I had a lot of fun. Lastly, the campus of Bol.com is also very nice with great food, out door seating and a super market on the ground floor. 

### The bad

About Bol.com there wasn't much *bad* honestly. I think one thing what made me look for other opportunities, was because it was just time to do so. I interned at Bol.com for 6 months + worked there for an additional 2 years. Also, my YP track was ending so it only felt natural leaving. So, yeah this was probably a click bait header.

## The future

So, what am I doing these days? In my second year at Bol.com I was working on implementing [Backstage.io](https://backstage.io/) within the company. Backstage is a developer experience portal developed by Spotify. So..... after a long interview I am proud to say I joined Spotify where I'll be working on the internal Backstage. Other than that I don't have much too say yet... check back after a year!
